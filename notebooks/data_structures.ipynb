    "For this experiment we will compare list algorithms for their use within Breadth First Search and Depth First Search.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Double Ended Queue (collections.deque)\n",

    "- queue.Queue\n",
    "- queue.LifoQueue\n",

    "- Pop oldest element.\n",
    "- Pop newest element.\n",
