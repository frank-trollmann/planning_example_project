    "Depth first search performed significantly better that the two other algorithms in all cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Dijkstra's algorithm was able to dredue on teh number of extended nodes in successful cases, it did not speed up the overall search time sufficiently to matter.\n",
    "The reason for the better performance of Depth first search is likely the higher computational overhead of the other algorithms (see time per extension) and the fact that the problem search space didn't allow them to counteract this overhead by finding a result in less steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that this experiment only compared the search times and ignored the time taken to run the layout algorithm. Had an informed algorithm outperformed the uninformed one, this time would have had to be taken into account."
