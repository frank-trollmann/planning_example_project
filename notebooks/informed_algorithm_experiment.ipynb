    "Heuristic search, on the other hand, performs worse for the three layout algorithms than it does without. As can be seen in the number of extended nodes, the algorithm does indeed profit from the coordinates as it visits less nodes. However, the time required per node grows. This is likely due to the need to sort the children of each node in order to identify the order in which to visit them. \n",

    "Overall, the fastest Algorithm on this dataset is Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to this general conclusion, we can derive a few more insights from the experiment:\n",
    "- In all three algorithms, the average time for sucessful runs were significantly lower than those for failed runs. On the one hand, this can be attributed to the fact that in failed runs the entire connected part of the graph has to be searched while sucessful runs can terminate once they find the goal. On the other hand, A* and Heuristic search perform significantly better that Dijkstra's algorithm on those cases. This indicates that the heuristic is helpful in reducing run time of these algorithms. In particular, A* reduces the number of extended nodes by a factor of almost ten.\n",
    "- A* is the algorithm that profits the most from the heuristic. The difference in average times between sucessful and failed runs is the by far the biggest of the three. The reason that A* does not come out best overall is likely twofold:\n",
    "   - A* has the highest time per extension due to the algorithmic complexity of keeping a priority queue of nodes and calculating the heuristci. \n",
    "   Due to the overall low number of successful cases (abouut 15% in this experiment), the advantage of A* does not come into play often enough for it to matter in the aveage time.\n",
    "- Heuristic search is faster mostly due to it's lower per extension time. While it extends more states than A* (though less than Dijkstra's Algorithm), it requires less time per state.\n",
