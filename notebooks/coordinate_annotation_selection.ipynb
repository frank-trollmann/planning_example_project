    "While this was not our main concern, the results also show some differences in how the coordinates affect Dijkstra's algorithm and A*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A* significantly outperforms Dijkstra in cases where a path exist. For \"auto\" and \"dlr\", A* is around 50 ms, while Dijkstra takes around 250 to 300 ms. This can be attributed by A* being able to make efficient use of the annotated coordinates. This can be seen clearly in the number of extended nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where no path exists, Dijkstra's algorithm is usually faster. This can be attributed to the lower algorithmic complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",

    "Over all cases, the two algorithms perform similarly. This is likely due to the fact that the majority of nodes are not connected via a path, meaning the advantage of A* doesn't come into play on enough cases to matter.\n"
